# Renewable-Energy-Powered-Smart-Window-Shield
Academic Freelancing Project taken as an Instructor. The goal of this project was to construct a Smart Window Shield.

I combined one UV Sensor, one Rain Sensor, one GSM Module, one Arduino Uno, one 16x2 LCD Display, two servo motors, and one DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor in this project. Under specific instances, the system will automatically open or close the window shield to protect residents, advise house owners about the room temperature, and contact SOS if an emergency happens.
